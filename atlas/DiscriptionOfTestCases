Discription of test cases

We are using unittest â€” the unit testing framework for Python
it is a class that has several simple methods that allows us to
run tests on the various methods of our program.



vector2 class:

setUp():
This method contains the following vectors
to run tests on:
		v0_0
		v1_2
		v5_5
		vMAX_MAX - used for edge testing using the maximum value for a float
		vMIN_MIN - used for edge testing using the minimum value for a float
		v50_0
		v0_50
		v100_0
		v0_100
		v100_100
		v500000_500000

test__init__():
This method runs before every unit test and initializes every
vector fresh for every test.

test_rotate():
This method tests the rotate functionality of the Vector2 class.

test_rotate_self():
This method tests the rotate_self method of the Vector2 class.

test_angle_between()
This method tests the angle_between two instances of the Vector2 class.

test_dot_product():
This method tests the dot product between two Vector2 classes.

test_distance_between():
This method tests the distance between two Vector2 classes.

test_subtract():
This method subtracts two instances of the Vecor2 class and 
checks the result.

test_length():
This method tests the length of a Vector2 class and checks
the result.

test_multiply_scalar_self():
This method checks the result of multiplying and instance of the Vector2
class by a scalar.

test_divide_scalar():
This method checks the result of dividing an instance of a Vector2 class
by a scalar.

test_divide_scalar_self():
This method checks the result of an instance of Vector2 dividing itself by a scalar.

test_normalize():
This method checks the normalization of a Vector2 class. 

test_equal():
This method checks that two instances of the Vector2 class are equal.
